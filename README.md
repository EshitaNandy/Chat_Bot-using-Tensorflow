How to Build an amazing contextual Chatbot using Tensorflow </br>

About this repository: 
- This is an introductory part of how to build a contexual Chatbot from scratch using Tensorflow. It will explain various key things like framework as we are going to use for building neural network model, structure and kind of data we are going to use for model training, introduction of intents etc. </br>
- It explains how to build an amazing contextual chatbot using Tensorflow and also covers some of the concepts related to Natural Language Processing in order to process text based question and answer data as well as explanation of Tensorflow code associated with the Chatbot. 
- Moreover, it explains how to create training data so that our deep neural network model can read it seamlessly and also covers developing the neural network model for chatbot by adding input, hidden and output layers using TFlearn as well as how to save deep learning model and intermediate data structures.
- Fivally it explains How to Build an Amazing Contextual Chatbot using Tensorflow and more specifically how to build a response processor so that we can converse with Chatbot in real time by asking question. We will get response based on questions we will ask.
